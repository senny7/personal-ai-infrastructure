# Risk Management Methodology

Standard corporate risk management process. We do system classification, then based on that do a control assessment to determine what needs to be implemented and what is implemented. Then we do risk assessments based on different scenarios with the assumption that if a control that mitigates the risk is implemented and reviewed as effective, then it lowers the inherent risk score, hopefully resulting in a residual risk score within appetite. The control framework used is NIST 800-171 rev3 the full json is available here /root/.claude/context/projects/nist171/cprt_SP_800_171_3_0_0_08-28-2025.json
