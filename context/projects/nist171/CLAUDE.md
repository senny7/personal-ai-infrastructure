# Project details

The organisation is going through a transition in how they do risk management, moving to a structured, data-driven way of conducting risk assessments and implementing enterpise grade technical controls on their applications.

In this model, applications are the building blocks, meaning that controls are assigned to applications and are tested, evidenced and reviewed as they relate to specific apps be them developed in-house or SaaS. 

NIST 800-171 rev3 is the gold standard used for controls and the tool used to track implementation and gather data is Ardoq. More about ardoq here ~/.claude/context/tools/ardoq/CLAUDE.md.

The standard is json format is here /root/.claude/context/projects/nist171/cprt_SP_800_171_3_0_0_08-28-2025.json
