Although organizations traditionally invest countless hours reviewing regulations such as the [Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/aml) and [the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-and-regulations/bank-secrecy-act), modern AI solutions offer a transformative approach to this challenge. By using [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/) alongside [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction)—an open source multi-agent orchestration framework, organizations can now deploy intelligent systems where multiple AI agents work together to automate and streamline specific compliance processes. This powerful combination enables financial institutions to move from manual, time-intensive compliance reviews to a streamlined, assisted compliance management approach that adapts to evolving regulatory requirements.\\n\\nIn this post, we explore how AI agents can streamline compliance and fulfill regulatory requirements for financial institutions using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and CrewAI. We demonstrate how to build a multi-agent system that can automatically summarize new regulations, assess their impact on operations, and provide prescriptive technical guidance. You’ll learn how to use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) with CrewAI to create a comprehensive, automated compliance solution.\\n\\nThis solution’s architecture can be adapted to help healthcare systems, enable manufacturers to maintain ISO safety documentation, and assist retailers in monitoring Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advertising regulations. It can also assist in other segments such as legal, finance, or human resources, offering wide-ranging potential for process automation and efficiency gains across various industries.The code used for this post is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-compliance-assistant-with-agents).\\n\\n## Solution overview\\n\\nTraditional [large language model (LLM)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/) applications excel at following predefined instructions, but solving complex challenges such as compliance automation requires an autonomous network of specialized agents that mirror the structure of a comprehensive compliance department. Our system employs three key agents:\\n\\n1. Compliance analyst agent that continuously monitors and analyzes regulatory changes\\n2.

Autonomous agents amplify both opportunity and risk; so it’s critical to ensure they operate within clearly defined, auditable boundaries.This article examines how to architect, implement, and manage guardrails for agentic AI, with real-world strategies, production-ready code, and recent best practices.\\n\\n## **Section 1: Why Guardrails Matter for Agentic AI**\\n\\nAutonomous agents operate at speed and scale, but unchecked actions can create security, compliance, and operational risk. Guardrails:\\n\\n- **Enforce Policy:** Define and restrict what agents can do; by role, context, or risk level.\\n- **Prevent Drift:** Ensure agents do not deviate from business intent or compliance frameworks.\\n- **Enable Trust:** Make agent decisions transparent, explainable, and auditable.\\n\\n**Published Quote:**“Guardrails are essential to balance agentic AI autonomy with enterprise security, ensuring agents act within policy while adapting to dynamic threats.”— [McKinsey Technology Insights, July 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/ai-governance-guardrails)\\n\\n## **Section 2: Architecting Policy-Driven Agentic AI**\\n\\n### **A. Centralized vs. Distributed Policy Engines**\\n\\n- **Centralized:** Policies managed and enforced from a single control plane.Examples: Azure Policy, Aria Policy, OPA (Open Policy Agent).\\n- **Distributed:** Each agent validates actions locally against synced policies.Ensures resilience if connectivity to the central engine fails.\\n\\n### **B. Policy Enforcement Points (PEP)**\\n\\nA Policy Enforcement Point intercepts agent actions and checks them against active policies before proceeding.\\n\\n### **Diagram: Policy Enforcement in Agentic Workflow**\\n\\n## **Section 3: Open Policy Agent in Python Agents**\\n\\nBelow is a modern, production-grade implementation using **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** to enforce policies in Python-based agents.Agents call OPA locally (or via REST) to validate intended actions before execution.\\n\\n### **Example: OPA Policy (Rego Language)**\\n\\n```\\npackage agenticai.policydefault allow = falseallow { input.agent == \\\"DeployAgent\\\" input.action == \\\"deploy_vm\\\" input.environment == \\\"production\\\" input.user_role == \\\"devops\\\"}\\n```\\n\\n_This policy allows DeployAgent to deploy VMs in production only if initiated by a DevOps user._\\n\\n### **Python Agent: Enforcing OPA Policy**\\n\\n```\\nimport requestsOPA_URL = \\\"http://localhost:8181/v1/data/agenticai/policy/allow\\\"def check_policy(agent, action, environment, user_role): payload = { \\\"input\\\": { \\\"agent\\\": agent, \\\"action\\\": action, \\\"environment\\\": environment, \\\"user_role\\\": user_role } } resp = requests.post(OPA_URL, json=payload) return resp.json().get(\\\"result\\\", False)def deploy_vm(): # Deployment logic here print(\\\"VM dep\",\n      \"image\": \"https://digitalthoughtdisruption.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-415.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://s0.wp.com/i/webclip.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17289\",\n      \"title\": \"Compliance Brain Assistant: Conversational Agentic AI for Assisting Compliance Tasks in Enterprise Environments\",\n      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17289\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-07-23T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025 (v1), last revised 26 Jul 2025 (this version, v3)]\",\n      \"text\": \"# Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n**arXiv:2507.17289** (cs)\\n\\n\\\\[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025 ( [v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17289v1)), last revised 26 Jul 2025 (this version, v3)\\\\]\\n\\n# Title:Compliance Brain Assistant: Conversational Agentic AI for Assisting Compliance Tasks in Enterprise Environments\\n\\nAuthors: [Shitong Zhu](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Zhu,+S), [Chenhao Fang](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Fang,+C), [Derek Larson](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Larson,+D), [Neel Reddy Pochareddy](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Pochareddy,+N+R), [Rajeev Rao](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Rao,+R), [Sophie Zeng](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Zeng,+S), [Yanqing Peng](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Peng,+Y), [Wendy Summer](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Summer,+W), [Alex Goncalves](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Goncalves,+A), [Arya Pudota](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Pudota,+A), [Hervé Robert](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Robert,+H)\\n\\nView a PDF of the paper titled Compliance Brain Assistant: Conversational Agentic AI for Assisting Compliance Tasks in Enterprise Environments, by Shitong Zhu and 10 other authors\\n\\n[View PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17289) [HTML (experimental)](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.17289v3)\\n\\n> Abstract:This paper presents Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), a conversational, agentic AI assistant designed to boost the efficiency of daily compliance tasks for personnel in enterprise environments. To strike a good balance between response quality and latency, we design a user query router that can intelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that only need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and (ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite actions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various compliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating requests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its description to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to query other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.\\n> Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on various real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various personas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's performance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and LLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full routing-based design against the \\\\`fast-track only\\\\` and \\\\`full-agentic\\\\` modes and found that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the run-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis \",\n      \"image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://arxiv.org/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/favicon-32x32.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.ignyteplatform.com/reckless-compliance/use-of-artificial-intelligence-for-nist-controls-responses-perspective-from-air-force-issm/\",\n      \"title\": \"Use of Artificial Intelligence for NIST Controls Responses - Perspective from Air Force ISSM - Ignyte\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.ignyteplatform.com/reckless-compliance/use-of-artificial-intelligence-for-nist-controls-responses-perspective-from-air-force-issm/\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2024-04-22T12:04:36.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"[Skip to content](https://www.ignyteplatform.com/www.ignyteplatform.com#content)\\n\\n[‹ All episodes](https://www.ignyteplatform.com/reckless-compliance/)\\n\\n## Reckless Compliance\\n\\n# Use of Artificial Intelligence for NIST Controls Responses – Perspective from Air Force ISSM\\n\\n- April 04, 2024\\n- Reckless Compliance\\n- 1\\n- 9\\n\\n## SHARE EPISODE\\n\\nJoin the Reckless Community\\n\\n- Show Notes\\n\\n- Transcript\\n\\n\\nMax Aulakh and Uliya Sparks, an ISSM at SAF Mission Partners Environment, discuss the potential of AI in federal compliance.

Whether triaging service tickets, automating policy enforcement, customizing user experiences or managing regulatory documentation, AI agents are no longer confined to experimental labs or innovation sandboxes. They are actively shaping how businesses deliver services, make decisions and scale operations.\\n\\nThese agents differ significantly from traditional bots or deterministic robotic process automation (RPA) systems. Built on large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and orchestration frameworks, they can reason, learn and act in ways that are context-aware, adaptive and often non-deterministic.\\n\\nIn a recent survey, over [90% of enterprise AI decision-makers reported concrete plans to adopt generative AI for internal and customer-facing use cases](https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/u3tOCoABOBfrNoL3i1frhpXcQE?domain=forrester.com). Yet, this enthusiasm arrives amidst a lack of regulatory clarity and governance models that are still catching up. As one Forrester analyst report notes, the generative AI boom has [thrust businesses into new territory where unknown risks abound](https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/iAXFCp9DzDhnrlN3IDhmhGLrwH?domain=forrester.com).\\n\\nThis transformation calls for a re-examination of how we think about risk, trust and control. As these agents interact with sensitive systems and high-stakes workflows, governance, risk and compliance (GRC) functions must evolve from static oversight to embedded, real-time governance.\\n\\n## What exactly are AI agents?\\n\\nAI agents are software programs designed to autonomously perform tasks by perceiving their environment, making decisions and executing actions. Unlike rule-based bots, agents:\\n\\n- Understand and interpret natural language\\n- Access internal and external data sources dynamically\\n- Invoke tools (like APIs, databases, search engines)\\n- Carry memory to recall prior interactions or results\\n- Chain logic to reason through complex multi-step tasks\\n\\nThey may be deployed through:\\n\\n- Open-source frameworks like LangChain or Semantic Kernel\\n-\",\n      \"image\": \"https://www.csoonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4008268-0-23324500-1750169651-cia-triad_security_triangle-glowing_binary_process_by-nolimit46-getty_2400x1600-100831589-orig.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.csoonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cropped-CSO-favicon-1-1.png?w=32\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.nrlabs.com/blog-posts/how-ai-is-transforming-federal-cybersecurity\",\n      \"title\": \"How AI is Transforming Federal Cybersecurity: Proven Use Cases from NR Labs\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.nrlabs.com/blog-posts/how-ai-is-transforming-federal-cybersecurity\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-05-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"[Get Started](https://www.nrlabs.com/www.nrlabs.com)\\n\\n# How AI is Transforming Federal Cybersecurity: Proven Use Cases from NR Labs\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 14, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael Browne, Rich Rafferty, and Luke Palmieri\\n\\n\\n\\n[Research](https://www.nrlabs.com/posts-categories/research)\\n\\n[View PDF Form](https://www.nrlabs.com/www.nrlabs.com)\\n\\n#### **Foreword**\\n\\nAs agencies navigate the growing complexity of cybersecurity threats and compliance demands, Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful lever to modernize and scale defenses. At NR Labs, our Cyber Innovation practice has developed a robust framework of AI use cases aligned to federal cybersecurity missions. Our approach is grounded in applied research and built on three (3) pillars:\\n\\n- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)/Risk Management Framework (RMF) Automation - AI-powered support for RMF Step6 (Monitor), Authority to Operate (ATO) acceleration, and continuous risk posture assessments for cloud vendors.\\n- Security Operations Center (SOC) Enablement - Enhanced threat triage, automated incident response (IR), and intelligence SOC orchestration.\\n- Red Teaming & Model Testing - Use of AI to augment adversarial emulation, vulnerability assessments, bias and fair ness evaluations, and safety/alignment testing of AI systems.\\n\\nWe work alongside federal cyber practitioners in across-sector, multi-disciplinary environments. Through a network of partnerships with cutting-edge AI-enabled software platforms, we’re helping our clients test and adopt AI use cases at speed. This blog outlines our journey, findings, and practical applications for federal agencies looking to safely integrate AI into their cybersecurity programs.\\n\\n#### **Introduction**\\n\\nBy now, everyone has heard the hype surrounding AI. But while headlines tout revolutionary breakthroughs, federal cybersecurity programs have seen limited progress in turning promise into practice.\\n\\nThat’s why, in May 2024, NR Labs launched a hands-on initiative to explore how AI can directly support cybersecurity missions. We stood up a Secure AI Testbed in Amazon Bedrock, where we tested adversarial agents andAI-enabled system defenders to simulate real-world cyber scenarios. This included identifying a novel technique that could bypass safety controls present in Amazon Guardrails and then designing mitigations to strengthen AI defenses against this technique through system prompting engineering.\\n\\nThese experiments made one thing clear: securing AI systems is only half the equation. The real value lies in AI-enabled cybersecurity: augmenting the work of cybersecurity professionals, accelerating control assessments, improving triage, and automating low-value tasks, so humans can focus on what matters most.\\n\\n#### **Background**\\n\\nThis initiative is driven by recent federal mandates accelerating the adoption of AI across government.

Implementing robust monitoring mechanisms to ensure DFARS compliance can be complex and resource-intensive. However, leveraging automation and artificial intelligence (AI) offers a transformative approach to streamline compliance efforts, enhance efficiency, and strengthen cybersecurity posture. In this blog post, we explore the benefits of using automation and AI for DFARS compliance monitoring and address common questions to provide insights and guidance.\\n\\n## The Role of Automation and AI in DFARS Compliance Monitoring\\n\\nAutomation and AI technologies revolutionize traditional compliance monitoring by enabling real-time data analysis, proactive threat detection, and continuous monitoring. These technologies empower organizations to:\\n\\n**Automate Data Collection:** Automatically gather and consolidate data from disparate sources, including network logs, system configurations, and user activities.\\n\\n**Continuous Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring capabilities to detect deviations from compliance requirements promptly.\\n\\n**Proactive Threat Detection:** Use AI algorithms to analyze patterns and anomalies in data, flagging potential security incidents or non-compliance issues.\\n\\n**Enhanced Reporting:** Generate comprehensive reports and dashboards that provide stakeholders with real-time insights into compliance status and potential risks.\\n\\n## Benefits of Automation and AI for DFARS Compliance\\n\\n**Efficiency:** Reduce manual efforts and human error associated with compliance monitoring tasks, allowing resources to focus on strategic initiatives.\\n\\n**Real-time Monitoring:** Enable proactive identification and mitigation of compliance gaps or security threats before they escalate.\\n\\n**Scalability:** Scale monitoring capabilities according to organizational growth or changes in compliance requirements without proportional increases in resources.\\n\\n**Cost-effectiveness:** Lower operational costs associated with compliance monitoring through automation, reducing the need for extensive manpower.\\n\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n### How can automation and AI assist in addressing specific DFARS requirements, such as incident response (IR) capabilities?\\n\\nAutomation can facilitate rapid incident detection and response by automating the collection and analysis of security event data. AI-powered tools can enhance IR capabilities by identifying patterns indicative of potential security incidents.\\n\\n### What are some challenges organizations may face when implementing automation and AI for DFARS compliance monitoring?\\n\\nChallenges may include initial setup costs, integration with existing systems, and ensuring AI models are tuned accurately to detect \",\n      \"image\": \"https://nist800171compliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/6-13-NIST-Main-Image.jpg\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://nist800171compliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-favicon-32x32-1-150x150.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2024/06/04/3-ways-ai-can-streamline-your-regulatory-compliance\",\n      \"title\": \"Streamlining Compliance with AI: Faster, Error-Free Audits | CSA\",\n      \"url\": \"https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2024/06/04/3-ways-ai-can-streamline-your-regulatory-compliance\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-12-08T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"# 3 Ways AI Can Streamline Your Regulatory Compliance\\n\\nPublished 06/04/2024\\n\\n[Home](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/)\\n\\n[Industry Insights](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog)\\n\\n3 Ways AI Can Streamline Your Regulatory Compliance\\n\\n**[Originally published](https://regscale.com/blog/3-ways-ai-can-streamline-your-regulatory-compliance/?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=csa&utm_content=blog) by RegScale.**\\n\\nIn an era where regulatory changes are fast and frequent, organizations have a difficult time keeping up. They fall behind on compliance and jeopardize passing their audits or inspections. To avoid falling behind even further, organizations need to speed up the compliance process, reduce errors, and streamline assessments.\\n\\nThankfully, there is one thing that’s evolving even faster than regulations: technology.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a perfect example. AI also happens to be a technology that’s ideally suited to helping CISOs and compliance practitioners streamline their audit preparation and eliminate fatigue. Here are a few ways how.\\n\\n### 1\\\\. AI can assist practitioners by automating error detection\\n\\nAt the heart of the matter, compliance management is ripe with significant challenges. The complexity of laws and regulations and their variances across countries, states, industries, and even products can be overwhelming. Add to this the constant updates and revisions, and the result is a maze that organizations must navigate with utmost caution.\\n\\nManual processes are slow and break, and many tools lack substantial autonomy from manual intervention. The risk of human error looms large, with the potential for significant financial penalties, reputational damage, and in some cases, criminal liability. The stakes are high, and the margin for error is slim. AI significantly reduces the risk of human error, a critical factor in compliance management where mistakes can have far-reaching consequences.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. AI can automate routine tasks\\n\\nCCM platforms, already focused on speed and automation, are further enhanced by AI features. These capabilities allow organizations to adapt to new regulations swiftly. AI can streamline the compliance process by automating routine functions, such as:\\n\\n- Data ingestion\\n- Control mapping\\n- Control writing, and\\n- Control assessments\\n\\nThis improves efficiency and frees up human resources to focus on more strategic aspects of compliance, such as policy development and implementation.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. AI can speed the compliance process\\n\\nAI and continuous controls monitoring (CCM) combine forces to speed every phase of the compliance process. By leveraging the power of machine learning and natural language processing, AI-enabled systems can sift through vast amounts of regulatory information in real-time, identifying relevant changes and promote updates throughout compliance documentation with precision.\\n\\nFrom extracting policies and controls to auditing controls for effectiveness, innovative features\",\n      \"image\": \"https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTY4MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ef6d14433e2ee9499e16db04774fc7850eec0a7d/Ultimate-Guide-to-Observability-What-It-Is-and-How-to-Do-It-Well.jpg\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://assets.cloudsecurityalliance.org/legacy/local-cdn/global/site/favicon/favicon-32x32.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://blog.stackaware.com/p/governing-ai-risk-with-the-nist-rmf\",\n      \"title\": \"Govern AI risk with the NIST RMF: policies, procedures, and compliance\",\n      \"url\": \"https://blog.stackaware.com/p/governing-ai-risk-with-the-nist-rmf\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2023-06-16T11:30:56.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Deploy Securely\",\n      \"text\": \"Everyone loves the word “governance.”\\n\\nSame with “AI.”\\n\\nSo in this post I’ll combine the two by looking at the first sub-part of the first function of the NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework ( [RMF](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf)), called GOVERN.

Although organizations traditionally invest countless hours reviewing regulations such as the [Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/aml) and [the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-and-regulations/bank-secrecy-act), modern AI solutions offer a transformative approach to this challenge. By using [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/) alongside [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction)—an open source multi-agent orchestration framework, organizations can now deploy intelligent systems where multiple AI agents work together to automate and streamline specific compliance processes. This powerful combination enables financial institutions to move from manual, time-intensive compliance reviews to a streamlined, assisted compliance management approach that adapts to evolving regulatory requirements.\\n\\nIn this post, we explore how AI agents can streamline compliance and fulfill regulatory requirements for financial institutions using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and CrewAI. We demonstrate how to build a multi-agent system that can automatically summarize new regulations, assess their impact on operations, and provide prescriptive technical guidance. You’ll learn how to use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) with CrewAI to create a comprehensive, automated compliance solution.\\n\\nThis solution’s architecture can be adapted to help healthcare systems, enable manufacturers to maintain ISO safety documentation, and assist retailers in monitoring Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advertising regulations.

Autonomous agents amplify both opportunity and risk; so it’s critical to ensure they operate within clearly defined, auditable boundaries.This article examines how to architect, implement, and manage guardrails for agentic AI, with real-world strategies, production-ready code, and recent best practices.\\n\\n## **Section 1: Why Guardrails Matter for Agentic AI**\\n\\nAutonomous agents operate at speed and scale, but unchecked actions can create security, compliance, and operational risk. Guardrails:\\n\\n- **Enforce Policy:** Define and restrict what agents can do; by role, context, or risk level.\\n- **Prevent Drift:** Ensure agents do not deviate from business intent or compliance frameworks.\\n- **Enable Trust:** Make agent decisions transparent, explainable, and auditable.\\n\\n**Published Quote:**“Guardrails are essential to balance agentic AI autonomy with enterprise security, ensuring agents act within policy while adapting to dynamic threats.”— [McKinsey Technology Insights, July 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/ai-governance-guardrails)\\n\\n## **Section 2: Architecting Policy-Driven Agentic AI**\\n\\n### **A. Centralized vs. Distributed Policy Engines**\\n\\n- **Centralized:** Policies managed and enforced from a single control plane.Examples: Azure Policy, Aria Policy, OPA (Open Policy Agent).\\n- **Distributed:** Each agent validates actions locally against synced policies.Ensures resilience if connectivity to the central engine fails.\\n\\n### **B.

To strike a good balance between response quality and latency, we design a user query router that can intelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that only need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and (ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite actions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various compliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating requests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its description to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to query other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.\\n> Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on various real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various personas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's performance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and LLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full routing-based design against the \\\\`fast-track only\\\\` and \\\\`full-agentic\\\\` modes and found that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the run-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis \",\n      \"image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://arxiv.org/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/favicon-32x32.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.ignyteplatform.com/reckless-compliance/use-of-artificial-intelligence-for-nist-controls-responses-perspective-from-air-force-issm/\",\n      \"title\": \"Use of Artificial Intelligence for NIST Controls Responses - Perspective from Air Force ISSM - Ignyte\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.ignyteplatform.com/reckless-compliance/use-of-artificial-intelligence-for-nist-controls-responses-perspective-from-air-force-issm/\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2024-04-22T12:04:36.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"[Skip to content](https://www.ignyteplatform.com/www.ignyteplatform.com#content)\\n\\n[‹ All episodes](https://www.ignyteplatform.com/reckless-compliance/)\\n\\n## Reckless Compliance\\n\\n# Use of Artificial Intelligence for NIST Controls Responses – Perspective from Air Force ISSM\\n\\n- April 04, 2024\\n- Reckless Compliance\\n- 1\\n- 9\\n\\n## SHARE EPISODE\\n\\nJoin the Reckless Community\\n\\n- Show Notes\\n\\n- Transcript\\n\\n\\nMax Aulakh and Uliya Sparks, an ISSM at SAF Mission Partners Environment, discuss the potential of AI in federal compliance.

Whether triaging service tickets, automating policy enforcement, customizing user experiences or managing regulatory documentation, AI agents are no longer confined to experimental labs or innovation sandboxes. They are actively shaping how businesses deliver services, make decisions and scale operations.\\n\\nThese agents differ significantly from traditional bots or deterministic robotic process automation (RPA) systems. Built on large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and orchestration frameworks, they can reason, learn and act in ways that are context-aware, adaptive and often non-deterministic.\\n\\nIn a recent survey, over [90% of enterprise AI decision-makers reported concrete plans to adopt generative AI for internal and customer-facing use cases](https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/u3tOCoABOBfrNoL3i1frhpXcQE?domain=forrester.com). Yet, this enthusiasm arrives amidst a lack of regulatory clarity and governance models that are still catching up. As one Forrester analyst report notes, the generative AI boom has [thrust businesses into new territory where unknown risks abound](https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/iAXFCp9DzDhnrlN3IDhmhGLrwH?domain=forrester.com).\\n\\nThis transformation calls for a re-examination of how we think about risk, trust and control. As these agents interact with sensitive systems and high-stakes workflows, governance, risk and compliance (GRC) functions must evolve from static oversight to embedded, real-time governance.\\n\\n## What exactly are AI agents?\\n\\nAI agents are software programs designed to autonomously perform tasks by perceiving their environment, making decisions and executing actions. Unlike rule-based bots, agents:\\n\\n- Understand and interpret natural language\\n- Access internal and external data sources dynamically\\n- Invoke tools (like APIs, databases, search engines)\\n- Carry memory to recall prior interactions or results\\n- Chain logic to reason through complex multi-step tasks\\n\\nThey may be deployed through:\\n\\n- Open-source frameworks like LangChain or Semantic Kernel\\n-\",\n      \"image\": \"https://www.csoonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4008268-0-23324500-1750169651-cia-triad_security_triangle-glowing_binary_process_by-nolimit46-getty_2400x1600-100831589-orig.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.csoonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cropped-CSO-favicon-1-1.png?w=32\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.nrlabs.com/blog-posts/how-ai-is-transforming-federal-cybersecurity\",\n      \"title\": \"How AI is Transforming Federal Cybersecurity: Proven Use Cases from NR Labs\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.nrlabs.com/blog-posts/how-ai-is-transforming-federal-cybersecurity\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-05-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"[Get Started](https://www.nrlabs.com/www.nrlabs.com)\\n\\n# How AI is Transforming Federal Cybersecurity: Proven Use Cases from NR Labs\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 14, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael Browne, Rich Rafferty, and Luke Palmieri\\n\\n\\n\\n[Research](https://www.nrlabs.com/posts-categories/research)\\n\\n[View PDF Form](https://www.nrlabs.com/www.nrlabs.com)\\n\\n#### **Foreword**\\n\\nAs agencies navigate the growing complexity of cybersecurity threats and compliance demands, Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful lever to modernize and scale defenses. At NR Labs, our Cyber Innovation practice has developed a robust framework of AI use cases aligned to federal cybersecurity missions. Our approach is grounded in applied research and built on three (3) pillars:\\n\\n- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)/Risk Management Framework (RMF) Automation - AI-powered support for RMF Step6 (Monitor), Authority to Operate (ATO) acceleration, and continuous risk posture assessments for cloud vendors.\\n- Security Operations Center (SOC) Enablement - Enhanced threat triage, automated incident response (IR), and intelligence SOC orchestration.\\n- Red Teaming & Model Testing - Use of AI to augment adversarial emulation, vulnerability assessments, bias and fair ness evaluations, and safety/alignment testing of AI systems.\\n\\nWe work alongside federal cyber practitioners in across-sector, multi-disciplinary environments. Through a network of partnerships with cutting-edge AI-enabled software platforms, we’re helping our clients test and adopt AI use cases at speed. This blog outlines our journey, findings, and practical applications for federal agencies looking to safely integrate AI into their cybersecurity programs.\\n\\n#### **Introduction**\\n\\nBy now, everyone has heard the hype surrounding AI. But while headlines tout revolutionary breakthroughs, federal cybersecurity programs have seen limited progress in turning promise into practice.\\n\\nThat’s why, in May 2024, NR Labs launched a hands-on initiative to explore how AI can directly support cybersecurity missions. We stood up a Secure AI Testbed in Amazon Bedrock, where we tested adversarial agents andAI-enabled system defenders to simulate real-world cyber scenarios. This included identifying a novel technique that could bypass safety controls present in Amazon Guardrails and then designing mitigations to strengthen AI defenses against this technique through system prompting engineering.\\n\\nThese experiments made one thing clear: securing AI systems is only half the equation. The real value lies in AI-enabled cybersecurity: augmenting the work of cybersecurity professionals, accelerating control assessments, improving triage, and automating low-value tasks, so humans can focus on what matters most.\\n\\n#### **Background**\\n\\nThis initiative is driven by recent federal mandates accelerating the adoption of AI across government.

To avoid falling behind even further, organizations need to speed up the compliance process, reduce errors, and streamline assessments.\\n\\nThankfully, there is one thing that’s evolving even faster than regulations: technology.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a perfect example. AI also happens to be a technology that’s ideally suited to helping CISOs and compliance practitioners streamline their audit preparation and eliminate fatigue. Here are a few ways how.\\n\\n### 1\\\\. AI can assist practitioners by automating error detection\\n\\nAt the heart of the matter, compliance management is ripe with significant challenges. The complexity of laws and regulations and their variances across countries, states, industries, and even products can be overwhelming. Add to this the constant updates and revisions, and the result is a maze that organizations must navigate with utmost caution.\\n\\nManual processes are slow and break, and many tools lack substantial autonomy from manual intervention. The risk of human error looms large, with the potential for significant financial penalties, reputational damage, and in some cases, criminal liability. The stakes are high, and the margin for error is slim. AI significantly reduces the risk of human error, a critical factor in compliance management where mistakes can have far-reaching consequences.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. AI can automate routine tasks\\n\\nCCM platforms, already focused on speed and automation, are further enhanced by AI features. These capabilities allow organizations to adapt to new regulations swiftly. AI can streamline the compliance process by automating routine functions, such as:\\n\\n- Data ingestion\\n- Control mapping\\n- Control writing, and\\n- Control assessments\\n\\nThis improves efficiency and frees up human resources to focus on more strategic aspects of compliance, such as policy development and implementation.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. AI can speed the compliance process\\n\\nAI and continuous controls monitoring (CCM) combine forces to speed every phase of the compliance process. By leveraging the power of machine learning and natural language processing, AI-enabled systems can sift through vast amounts of regulatory information in real-time, identifying relevant changes and promote updates throughout compliance documentation with precision.\\n\\nFrom extracting policies and controls to auditing controls for effectiveness, innovative features\",\n      \"image\": \"https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTY4MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ef6d14433e2ee9499e16db04774fc7850eec0a7d/Ultimate-Guide-to-Observability-What-It-Is-and-How-to-Do-It-Well.jpg\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://assets.cloudsecurityalliance.org/legacy/local-cdn/global/site/favicon/favicon-32x32.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://blog.stackaware.com/p/governing-ai-risk-with-the-nist-rmf\",\n      \"title\": \"Govern AI risk with the NIST RMF: policies, procedures, and compliance\",\n      \"url\": \"https://blog.stackaware.com/p/governing-ai-risk-with-the-nist-rmf\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2023-06-16T11:30:56.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Deploy Securely\",\n      \"text\": \"Everyone loves the word “governance.”\\n\\nSame with “AI.”\\n\\nSo in this post I’ll combine the two by looking at the first sub-part of the first function of the NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework ( [RMF](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf)), called GOVERN.

Although organizations traditionally invest countless hours reviewing regulations such as the [Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/aml) and [the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-and-regulations/bank-secrecy-act), modern AI solutions offer a transformative approach to this challenge. By using [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/) alongside [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction)—an open source multi-agent orchestration framework, organizations can now deploy intelligent systems where multiple AI agents work together to automate and streamline specific compliance processes. This powerful combination enables financial institutions to move from manual, time-intensive compliance reviews to a streamlined, assisted compliance management approach that adapts to evolving regulatory requirements.\\n\\nIn this post, we explore how AI agents can streamline compliance and fulfill regulatory requirements for financial institutions using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and CrewAI. We demonstrate how to build a multi-agent system that can automatically summarize new regulations, assess their impact on operations, and provide prescriptive technical guidance. You’ll learn how to use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) with CrewAI to create a comprehensive, automated compliance solution.\\n\\nThis solution’s architecture can be adapted to help healthcare systems, enable manufacturers to maintain ISO safety documentation, and assist retailers in monitoring Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advertising regulations. It can also assist in other segments such as legal, finance, or human resources, offering wide-ranging potential for process automation and efficiency gains across various industries.The code used for this post is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-compliance-assistant-with-agents).\\n\\n## Solution overview\\n\\nTraditional [large language model (LLM)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/) applications excel at following predefined instructions, but solving complex challenges such as compliance automation requires an autonomous network of specialized agents that mirror the structure of a comprehensive compliance department.

In 2025, AI agents are expected to become integral to business operations, with [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/press-room/deloitte-globals-2025-predictions-report.html) predicting that 25% of enterprises using generative AI will deploy AI agents, growing to 50% by 2027. The [global AI agent space](https://aimresearch.co/ai-startups/vertical-ai-agents-will-dominate-2025) is projected to surge from $5.1 billion in 2024 to $47.1 billion by 2030, reflecting the transformative potential of these technologies.\\n\\nIn this post, we explore how [CrewAI’s open source agentic framework](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction), combined with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), enables the creation of sophisticated multi-agent systems that can transform how businesses operate. Through practical examples and implementation details, we demonstrate how to build, deploy, and orchestrate AI agents that can tackle complex tasks with minimal human oversight. Although “agents” is the buzzword of 2025, it’s important to understand what an AI agent is and where deploying an agentic system could yield benefits.\\n\\n## Agentic design\\n\\nAn AI agent is an autonomous, intelligent system that uses large language models (LLMs) and other AI capabilities to perform complex tasks with minimal human oversight. Unlike traditional software, which follows pre-defined rules, AI agents can operate independently, learn from their environment, adapt to changing conditions, and make contextual decisions. They are designed with modular components, such as reasoning engines, memory, cognitive skills, and tools, that enable them to execute sophisticated workflows. Traditional SaaS solutions are designed for horizontal scalability and general applicability, which makes them suitable for managing repetitive tasks across diverse sectors, but they often lack domain-specific intelligence and the flexibility to address unique challenges in dynamic environments. Agentic systems, on the other hand, are designed to bridge this gap by combining the flexibility of context-aware systems with domain knowledge. Consider a software development use case AI agents can generate, evaluate, and improve code, shifting software engineers’ focus from routine coding to more complex design challenges. For example, for the CrewAI git repository, pull requests are evaluated by a set of CrewAI agents who review code based on code documentation, consistency of implementation, and security considerations. Another use case can be seen in supply chain managem\",\n      \"image\": \"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/03/28/image001-1156x630.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://a0.awsstatic.com/main/images/site/fav/favicon.ico\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.paulmduvall.com/ai-agents-for-aws-security-businesses/\",\n      \"title\": \"Revolutionizing AWS Security with AI Agents and CrewAI\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.paulmduvall.com/ai-agents-for-aws-security-businesses/\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-01-21T14:38:42.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Paul Duvall\",\n      \"text\": \"- [![Paul Duvall](https://www.paulmduvall.com/content/images/size/w100/2024/11/2024-10-30-profile-1.jpeg)](https://www.paulmduvall.com/author/paul/)\\n\\n![AI Agents for AWS Security Businesses](https://www.paulmduvall.com/content/images/size/w2000/2025/01/ai-security-agent-2-1.jpg)\\n\\nIn today’s dynamic cloud security landscape, maintaining robust security while scaling your business is critical. Traditional methods often fail to address the speed and complexity of modern threats. Enter AI agents: autonomous software entities designed to perform specific tasks, much like human team members. By combining AI agents with a framework like [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI?ref=paulmduvall.com), you can create high-level “Crews” that deliver a scalable, efficient, and secure approach to cloud security.\\n\\nThis post explores how to integrate AI agents within AWS Security environments. Whether you’re enhancing threat detection, automating compliance, or streamlining incident response, AI agents can transform how you secure AWS workloads.\\n\\n### **Understanding CrewAI Concepts**\\n\\nCrewAI mirrors real-world team structures in software, facilitating collaboration among various components:\\n\\n1. **Crew:** The highest-level entity. A Crew is a group of agents working collaboratively to execute workflows and achieve specific objectives.\\n2. **Workflow:** A Workflow defines the end-to-end pipeline of processes, tasks, and agents. It orchestrates multiple processes to complete a larger goal.\\n3. **Process:** A structured sequence of tasks with defined dependencies and conditions, executed by agents. Processes serve as building blocks within a workflow, enabling more granular control and reusability.\\n4. **Agent:** An autonomous worker capable of performing tasks. Agents are the operational units responsible for task execution.\\n5. **Task:** The smallest unit of work. Tasks encapsulate logic and specify the inputs required for execution. Each task is performed by an agent.\\n6. **Tools:** Reusable utility functions, scripts, or libraries that assist agents and tasks. Tools encapsulate common actions and logic, simplifying the creation and maintenance of tasks.\\n\\n### **Why Use CrewAI for AWS Security?**\\n\\n**CrewAI** structures AI-driven workflows in a way that closely resembles a human team. By leveraging human-in-the-loop (HITL) decision-making, CrewAI allows you to maintain ethical, contextual, and compliance-oriented oversight while still benefiting from automation.\\n\\n- **Scalability:** Crews, composed of specialized agents, can easily be expanded or repurposed.\\n- **Modularity:** Workflows can be broken into smaller processes, tasks, and tools for easy reuse.\\n- **Human Oversight:** HITL ensures critical decisions involve experts where needed.\\n\\n## Sign up for AWS Techpreneur\\n\\nAccelerating Growth for AWS Security Businesses and Entrepreneurs\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nEmail sent!

Protocol: Bridging AI and Enterprise Reality](https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/the-agentic-imperative-series-part-1-model-context-protocol-bridging-ai-and-enterprise-reality-52caa5b8b580) — In this second part, we will dive into the mechanics, use cases, and comparative strengths of two prominent AI orchestration frameworks: **Crew AI** and **Semantic Kernel**.

As an orchestration framework, it empowers users to assemble and manage teams of specialized AI agents, each tailored to perform specific tasks within an organized workflow. Just as a well-run organization delegates roles and responsibilities among its departments, [**CrewAI**](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) assigns defined roles to its agents, ensuring seamless collaboration toward achieving a shared objective.\\n\\n**Core Principles of CrewAI**\\n\\n\",\n      \"image\": \"http://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-17-at-7.47.53 PM.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/cropped-Favicon-512-x-512-1-1-32x32.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.cohorte.co/blog/the-friendly-developers-guide-to-crewai-for-support-bots-workflow-automation\",\n      \"title\": \"The Friendly Developer’s Guide to CrewAI for Support Bots & Workflow Automation\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.cohorte.co/blog/the-friendly-developers-guide-to-crewai-for-support-bots-workflow-automation\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-05-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Cohorte\",\n      \"text\": \"[Blog](https://www.cohorte.co/blog) [Letters](https://www.cohorte.co/letters) [Get Started](https://www.cohorte.co/step-inside/get-started)\\n\\n[Get Started](https://www.cohorte.co/get-started)\\n\\n# The Friendly Developer’s Guide to CrewAI for Support Bots & Workflow Automation\\n\\nCrewAI lets you build AI agents that work together like a real team. This guide shows how to create support bots and automate business workflows using CrewAI’s crew-and-flow model. It includes practical Python examples, deployment tips, and a community-informed comparison with OpenAI’s Agent SDK. Ideal for developers and AI leaders exploring multi-agent systems that actually work in production.\\n\\nBuilding AI-driven customer support bots and business process automation agents can feel like assembling an elite team of digital coworkers. In this guide, we’ll explore **CrewAI** – a popular open-source framework for orchestrating multiple AI agents – and how it can help you create collaborative support bots and automated workflows. We’ll walk through key concepts in a conversational tone (with a dash of humor), show code snippets in Python, offer tips for production deployment, and even compare CrewAI with OpenAI’s new Agent SDK based on community insights. Let’s dive in!\\n\\n## What is CrewAI?\\n\\n**CrewAI** is a framework designed to let multiple AI agents work together **as a team**. Think of a “crew” of AI agents, each with specific roles and goals, collaborating to handle complex tasks autonomously [‍](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI#:~:text=1,based%20collaboration.%20Crews%20enable). For example, in a customer support scenario, one agent could handle answering user questions while another fetches data from the knowledge base. CrewAI provides the structure (called _Crews_ and _Flows_) to coordinate these agents seamlessly, so they can delegate tasks and cooperate much like humans do in a team. In essence, CrewAI empowers developers to build AI solutions that **balance autonomy and control** – agents have the freedom to make decisions, but you still guide the overall workflow [‍](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI#:~:text=%2A%20Fine,branching%20for%20complex%20business%20logic).\\n\\n**Key idea:** The term “crew” in CrewAI literally means a crew of agents working together [‍](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=What%20is%20crewAI%3F%20,work%20together%20to%20autonomously). Each agent can be given a role (like “Support Representative” or “Data Analyst”), a goal (their mission), and even a backstory or persona to shape their behavior. CrewAI’s job is to orchestrate these agents through defined tasks and workflows, ensuring they collaborate effectively to achieve a bigger objective.\\n\\n## CrewAI’s Two Core Concepts: Crews & Flows\\n\\nCrewAI provides two main abstractions to structure your AI system [‍](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI#:~:text=Understanding%20Flows%20and%20Crews):\\n\\n- **Crews:** A **Crew** is a set of AI agents with autonomy and the ability to interact with eac\",\n      \"image\": \"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66841c2a95405226a60d332e/681b1092145a987ec9697794_Crew_AI_compressed.webp\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6678748f8854ad6b0af1cb7c/67bb363ac57a2790a8763f7a_favcon_cohorte.svg\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"searchTime\": 6075.1,\n  \"costDollars\": {\n    \"total\": 0.012,\n    \"search\": {\n      \"neural\": 0.005\n    },\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"text\": 0.007\n    }\n  }\n}"}]}]},"uuid":"83c5ad5a-e521-4a03-a29c-4b6aab454341","timestamp":"2025-08-12T15:07:55.709Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"{\n  \"requestId\": \"a52b6c16e61ee58796c8a9ab95b825ca\",\n  \"autopromptString\": \"multi-agent systems security compliance documentation automation CrewAI specialized subagents\",\n  \"resolvedSearchType\": \"neural\",\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/automating-regulatory-compliance-a-multi-agent-solution-using-amazon-bedrock-and-crewai/\",\n      \"title\": \"A multi-agent solution using Amazon Bedrock and CrewAI\",\n      \"url\": \"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/automating-regulatory-compliance-a-multi-agent-solution-using-amazon-bedrock-and-crewai/\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-04-10T16:39:31.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"[Skip to Main Content](https://aws.amazon.com/aws.amazon.com#aws-page-content-main)\\n\\n## [Artificial Intelligence](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/)\\n\\n# Automating regulatory compliance: A multi-agent solution using Amazon Bedrock and CrewAI\\n\\nFinancial institutions today face an increasingly complex regulatory world that demands robust, efficient compliance mechanisms. Although organizations traditionally invest countless hours reviewing regulations such as the [Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/aml) and [the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-and-regulations/bank-secrecy-act), modern AI solutions offer a transformative approach to this challenge. By using [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/) alongside [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction)—an open source multi-agent orchestration framework, organizations can now deploy intelligent systems where multiple AI agents work together to automate and streamline specific compliance processes. This powerful combination enables financial institutions to move from manual, time-intensive compliance reviews to a streamlined, assisted compliance management approach that adapts to evolving regulatory requirements.\\n\\nIn this post, we explore how AI agents can streamline compliance and fulfill regulatory requirements for financial institutions using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and CrewAI. We demonstrate how to build a multi-agent system that can automatically summarize new regulations, assess their impact on operations, and provide prescriptive technical guidance. You’ll learn how to use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) with CrewAI to create a comprehensive, automated compliance solution.\\n\\nThis solution’s architecture can be adapted to help healthcare systems, enable manufacturers to maintain ISO safety documentation, and assist retailers in monitoring Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advertising regulations. It can also assist in other segments such as legal, finance, or human resources, offering wide-ranging potential for process automation and efficiency gains across various industries.The code used for this post is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-compliance-assistant-with-agents).\\n\\n## Solution overview\\n\\nTraditional [large language model (LLM)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/) applications excel at following predefined instructions, but solving complex challenges such as compliance automation requires an autonomous network of specialized agents that mirror the structure of a comprehensive compliance department. Our system employs three key agents:\\n\\n1. Compliance analyst agent that continuously monitors and analyzes regulatory changes\\n2.

In 2025, AI agents are expected to become integral to business operations, with [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/press-room/deloitte-globals-2025-predictions-report.html) predicting that 25% of enterprises using generative AI will deploy AI agents, growing to 50% by 2027. The [global AI agent space](https://aimresearch.co/ai-startups/vertical-ai-agents-will-dominate-2025) is projected to surge from $5.1 billion in 2024 to $47.1 billion by 2030, reflecting the transformative potential of these technologies.\\n\\nIn this post, we explore how [CrewAI’s open source agentic framework](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction), combined with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), enables the creation of sophisticated multi-agent systems that can transform how businesses operate. Through practical examples and implementation details, we demonstrate how to build, deploy, and orchestrate AI agents that can tackle complex tasks with minimal human oversight. Although “agents” is the buzzword of 2025, it’s important to understand what an AI agent is and where deploying an agentic system could yield benefits.\\n\\n## Agentic design\\n\\nAn AI agent is an autonomous, intelligent system that uses large language models (LLMs) and other AI capabilities to perform complex tasks with minimal human oversight. Unlike traditional software, which follows pre-defined rules, AI agents can operate independently, learn from their environment, adapt to changing conditions, and make contextual decisions. They are designed with modular components, such as reasoning engines, memory, cognitive skills, and tools, that enable them to execute sophisticated workflows. Traditional SaaS solutions are designed for horizontal scalability and general applicability, which makes them suitable for managing repetitive tasks across diverse sectors, but they often lack domain-specific intelligence and the flexibility to address unique challenges in dynamic environments. Agentic systems, on the other hand, are designed to bridge this gap by combining the flexibility of context-aware systems with domain knowledge. Consider a software development use case AI agents can generate, evaluate, and improve code, shifting software engineers’ focus from routine coding to more complex design challenges. For example, for the CrewAI git repository, pull requests are evaluated by a set of CrewAI agents who review code based on code documentation, consistency of implementation, and security considerations. Another use case can be seen in supply chain managem\",\n      \"image\": \"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/03/28/image001-1156x630.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://a0.awsstatic.com/main/images/site/fav/favicon.ico\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.paulmduvall.com/ai-agents-for-aws-security-businesses/\",\n      \"title\": \"Revolutionizing AWS Security with AI Agents and CrewAI\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.paulmduvall.com/ai-agents-for-aws-security-businesses/\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-01-21T14:38:42.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Paul Duvall\",\n      \"text\": \"- [![Paul Duvall](https://www.paulmduvall.com/content/images/size/w100/2024/11/2024-10-30-profile-1.jpeg)](https://www.paulmduvall.com/author/paul/)\\n\\n![AI Agents for AWS Security Businesses](https://www.paulmduvall.com/content/images/size/w2000/2025/01/ai-security-agent-2-1.jpg)\\n\\nIn today’s dynamic cloud security landscape, maintaining robust security while scaling your business is critical. Traditional methods often fail to address the speed and complexity of modern threats. Enter AI agents: autonomous software entities designed to perform specific tasks, much like human team members. By combining AI agents with a framework like [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI?ref=paulmduvall.com), you can create high-level “Crews” that deliver a scalable, efficient, and secure approach to cloud security.\\n\\nThis post explores how to integrate AI agents within AWS Security environments. Whether you’re enhancing threat detection, automating compliance, or streamlining incident response, AI agents can transform how you secure AWS workloads.\\n\\n### **Understanding CrewAI Concepts**\\n\\nCrewAI mirrors real-world team structures in software, facilitating collaboration among various components:\\n\\n1. **Crew:** The highest-level entity. A Crew is a group of agents working collaboratively to execute workflows and achieve specific objectives.\\n2. **Workflow:** A Workflow defines the end-to-end pipeline of processes, tasks, and agents. It orchestrates multiple processes to complete a larger goal.\\n3. **Process:** A structured sequence of tasks with defined dependencies and conditions, executed by agents. Processes serve as building blocks within a workflow, enabling more granular control and reusability.\\n4. **Agent:** An autonomous worker capable of performing tasks. Agents are the operational units responsible for task execution.\\n5. **Task:** The smallest unit of work. Tasks encapsulate logic and specify the inputs required for execution. Each task is performed by an agent.\\n6. **Tools:** Reusable utility functions, scripts, or libraries that assist agents and tasks. Tools encapsulate common actions and logic, simplifying the creation and maintenance of tasks.\\n\\n### **Why Use CrewAI for AWS Security?**\\n\\n**CrewAI** structures AI-driven workflows in a way that closely resembles a human team. By leveraging human-in-the-loop (HITL) decision-making, CrewAI allows you to maintain ethical, contextual, and compliance-oriented oversight while still benefiting from automation.\\n\\n- **Scalability:** Crews, composed of specialized agents, can easily be expanded or repurposed.\\n- **Modularity:** Workflows can be broken into smaller processes, tasks, and tools for easy reuse.\\n- **Human Oversight:** HITL ensures critical decisions involve experts where needed.\\n\\n## Sign up for AWS Techpreneur\\n\\nAccelerating Growth for AWS Security Businesses and Entrepreneurs\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nEmail sent!

Protocol: Bridging AI and Enterprise Reality](https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/the-agentic-imperative-series-part-1-model-context-protocol-bridging-ai-and-enterprise-reality-52caa5b8b580) — In this second part, we will dive into the mechanics, use cases, and comparative strengths of two prominent AI orchestration frameworks: **Crew AI** and **Semantic Kernel**. Crew AI facilitates collaborative intelligence by orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents, enabling complex problem-solving through role-based delegation and inter-agent communication. Semantic Kernel integrates AI capabilities directly into existing software ecosystems, providing semantic orchestration that blends AI-driven reasoning with structured workflows. We’ll examine each framework’s independent functionality, explore real-world industry applications, analyze technical implementation examples, and assess their respective advantages, limitations, and optimal deployment scenarios.\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nModern AI ecosystems are increasingly leveraging **multi-agent frameworks** and **semantic int\",\n      \"image\": \"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*ffNxtJ085sKBoNDHDSIKqQ.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/01/17/crewai-a-guide-to-agentic-ai-collaboration-and-workflow-optimization-with-code-implementation/\",\n      \"title\": \"CrewAI: A Guide to Agentic AI Collaboration and Workflow Optimization with Code Implementation\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/01/17/crewai-a-guide-to-agentic-ai-collaboration-and-workflow-optimization-with-code-implementation/\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-01-17T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Asif Razzaq\",\n      \"text\": \"[Discord](https://pxl.to/ivxz41s)[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marktechpost/?viewAsMember=true)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearningnews/)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Marktechpost)\\n\\n- [Home](https://www.marktechpost.com/)\\n- [Open Source/Weights](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/technology/open-source/)\\n- [Enterprise AI](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/enterprise-ai/)\\n- [AI Tools & Agents](https://aitoolsclub.com/)\\n- [miniCON 2025](https://minicon.marktechpost.com/)\\n- [Tutorials](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/tutorials/)\\n- [Advertise](http://promotion.marktechpost.com/)\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n[NewsHub](https://www.marktechpost.com/)\\n\\nMy account\\n\\nGet into your account.\\n\\n[Login](https://www.marktechpost.com/my-account-news-hub-pro/) [Register](https://www.marktechpost.com/login-register/?signup)\\n\\n[NewsHub](https://www.marktechpost.com/)\\n\\n[Premium Content](https://www.marktechpost.com/www.marktechpost.com)\\n\\n[Read our exclusive articles](https://www.marktechpost.com/www.marktechpost.com)\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.marktechpost.com/www.marktechpost.com)\\n\\n[Instagram](https://www.marktechpost.com/www.marktechpost.com)\\n\\n[Twitter](https://www.marktechpost.com/www.marktechpost.com)\\n\\n- [Home](https://www.marktechpost.com/)\\n- [Open Source/Weights](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/technology/open-source/)\\n- [Enterprise AI](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/enterprise-ai/)\\n- [AI Tools & Agents](https://aitoolsclub.com/)\\n- [miniCON 2025](https://minicon.marktechpost.com/)\\n- [Tutorials](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/tutorials/)\\n- [Advertise](http://promotion.marktechpost.com/)\\n\\n[NewsHub](https://www.marktechpost.com/)\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n- [Home](https://www.marktechpost.com/)\\n- [Open Source/Weights](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/technology/open-source/)\\n- [Enterprise AI](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/enterprise-ai/)\\n- [AI Tools & Agents](https://aitoolsclub.com/)\\n- [miniCON 2025](https://minicon.marktechpost.com/)\\n- [Tutorials](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/tutorials/)\\n- [Advertise](http://promotion.marktechpost.com/)\\n\\n[Home](https://www.marktechpost.com/)[Editors Pick](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/)[Agentic AI](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/agentic-ai/)CrewAI: A Guide to Agentic AI Collaboration and Workflow Optimization with Code...\\n\\n[**CrewAI**](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) is an innovative platform that transforms how AI agents collaborate to solve complex problems. As an orchestration framework, it empowers users to assemble and manage teams of specialized AI agents, each tailored to perform specific tasks within an organized workflow. Just as a well-run organization delegates roles and responsibilities among its departments, [**CrewAI**](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) assigns defined roles to its agents, ensuring seamless collaboration toward achieving a shared objective.\\n\\n**Core Principles of CrewAI**\\n\\n\",\n      \"image\": \"http://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-17-at-7.47.53 PM.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/cropped-Favicon-512-x-512-1-1-32x32.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.cohorte.co/blog/the-friendly-developers-guide-to-crewai-for-support-bots-workflow-automation\",\n      \"title\": \"The Friendly Developer’s Guide to CrewAI for Support Bots & Workflow Automation\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.cohorte.co/blog/the-friendly-developers-guide-to-crewai-for-support-bots-workflow-automation\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-05-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Cohorte\",\n      \"text\": \"[Blog](https://www.cohorte.co/blog) [Letters](https://www.cohorte.co/letters) [Get Started](https://www.cohorte.co/step-inside/get-started)\\n\\n[Get Started](https://www.cohorte.co/get-started)\\n\\n# The Friendly Developer’s Guide to CrewAI for Support Bots & Workflow Automation\\n\\nCrewAI lets you build AI agents that work together like a real team. This guide shows how to create support bots and automate business workflows using CrewAI’s crew-and-flow model. It includes practical Python examples, deployment tips, and a community-informed comparison with OpenAI’s Agent SDK. Ideal for developers and AI leaders exploring multi-agent systems that actually work in production.\\n\\nBuilding AI-driven customer support bots and business process automation agents can feel like assembling an elite team of digital coworkers. In this guide, we’ll explore **CrewAI** – a popular open-source framework for orchestrating multiple AI agents – and how it can help you create collaborative support bots and automated workflows. We’ll walk through key concepts in a conversational tone (with a dash of humor), show code snippets in Python, offer tips for production deployment, and even compare CrewAI with OpenAI’s new Agent SDK based on community insights. Let’s dive in!\\n\\n## What is CrewAI?\\n\\n**CrewAI** is a framework designed to let multiple AI agents work together **as a team**. Think of a “crew” of AI agents, each with specific roles and goals, collaborating to handle complex tasks autonomously [‍](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI#:~:text=1,based%20collaboration.%20Crews%20enable). For example, in a customer support scenario, one agent could handle answering user questions while another fetches data from the knowledge base. CrewAI provides the structure (called _Crews_ and _Flows_) to coordinate these agents seamlessly, so they can delegate tasks and cooperate much like humans do in a team. In essence, CrewAI empowers developers to build AI solutions that **balance autonomy and control** – agents have the freedom to make decisions, but you still guide the overall workflow [‍](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI#:~:text=%2A%20Fine,branching%20for%20complex%20business%20logic).\\n\\n**Key idea:** The term “crew” in CrewAI literally means a crew of agents working together [‍](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=What%20is%20crewAI%3F%20,work%20together%20to%20autonomously). Each agent can be given a role (like “Support Representative” or “Data Analyst”), a goal (their mission), and even a backstory or persona to shape their behavior. CrewAI’s job is to orchestrate these agents through defined tasks and workflows, ensuring they collaborate effectively to achieve a bigger objective.\\n\\n## CrewAI’s Two Core Concepts: Crews & Flows\\n\\nCrewAI provides two main abstractions to structure your AI system [‍](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI#:~:text=Understanding%20Flows%20and%20Crews):\\n\\n- **Crews:** A **Crew** is a set of AI agents with autonomy and the ability to interact with eac\",\n      \"image\": \"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66841c2a95405226a60d332e/681b1092145a987ec9697794_Crew_AI_compressed.webp\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6678748f8854ad6b0af1cb7c/67bb363ac57a2790a8763f7a_favcon_cohorte.svg\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"searchTime\": 6075.1,\n  \"costDollars\": {\n    \"total\": 0.012,\n    \"search\": {\n      \"neural\": 0.005\n    },\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"text\": 0.007\n    }\n  }\n}"}]}

These controls are typically implemented by Infrastructure teams but coordinated by System Owners. ODPs are set using best-in-class recommendations: PFS-1 (30-minute session timeout, 3 failed login attempts); PFS-2 (WPA3 for wireless, certificate-based device authentication); PFS-3 (DMZ implementation, default-deny policies); PFS-4 (AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit).\n\nPlatform Security (PFS) Requirements\n\n\n\n# PFS-1 (3.1.8, 3.1.10, 3.1.11, 3.1.13, 3.1.14): Implement session management controls including failed login limits, automatic session termination, and cryptographic protection for remote access sessions.\n\n## Control Details:\n\nSession management controls are implemented across all system access points to prevent unauthorized access and protect active sessions. Failed login attempts are limited to 3 attempts before account lockout, with lockout duration and reset procedures defined in organizational policy.\n\nAutomatic session termination occurs after 30 minutes of inactivity or upon user logout, with authentication tokens expiring to prevent unauthorized session reuse. Session timeout periods may be adjusted based on system sensitivity and operational requirements.\n\nRemote access sessions are protected using cryptographic mechanisms including TLS 1.3 for web-based access and SSH for terminal sessions. All remote access is routed through managed access control points such as VPN gateways or privileged access management solutions.\n\nInfrastructure teams implement these controls at the platform level, while System Owners coordinate requirements and ensure consistent application across all system components.\n\n\n# PFS-2 (3.1.16, 3.1.17, 3.1.18, 3.7.4, 3.8.3, 3.8.1, 3.8.4, 3.8.5): Control wireless and mobile device access through authentication, encryption, device management policies, and comprehensive media protection.\n\n## Control Details:\n\nWireless access to systems requires prior authorization and enforcement of security requirements including WPA3 encryption for wireless communications. Wireless network segmentation isolates system access from general corporate networks.\n\nMobile device connections are controlled through device management policies that require device registration, compliance verification, and certificate-based authentication. Mobile devices accessing sensitive systems must meet organizational security baseline requirements.\n\nAuthentication mechanisms for wireless and mobile access include certificate-based device authentication and multi-factor authentication for user access. Encryption standards ensure secure communications between devices and system components.\n\nDevice management policies include approval and monitoring of system tools, verification of media integrity, secure handling of equipment containing sensitive data through sanitization or controlled retention procedures, and proper sanitization or destruction of system media before disposal, release, or reuse to prevent data recovery.\n\nMedia protection controls require that all system media containing sensitive information (both paper and digital) be protected to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure. Media must be marked with appropriate labels to indicate handling requirements and classification levels. Media containing sensitive information is protected and controlled during transport outside of controlled areas using physical or cryptographic safeguards.\n\nInfrastructure teams manage wireless infrastructure and device management platforms, while System Owners coordinate device access requirements and ensure compliance with application security policies.\n\n\n# PFS-3 (3.13.5, 3.13.6, 3.13.7): Implement network segmentation with DMZ deployment, default-deny policies, and controlled remote device connections.\n\n## Control Details:\n\nCritical applications are deployed with network segmentation that includes DMZ implementation for publicly accessible system components. DMZ networks are physically or logically separated from internal networks with controlled access points.\n\nNetwork access controls implement default-deny policies at network interfaces, allowing traffic only by explicit exception. Network policies are documented and regularly reviewed to ensure minimal necessary access is maintained.\n\nRemote device connections to systems are prevented by default unless explicitly authorized through network access control mechanisms. Authorized connections require device authentication and compliance verification before network access is granted.\n\nInfrastructure teams implement network segmentation, firewall policies, and access control mechanisms, while System Owners coordinate network requirements and ensure application-specific access needs are properly documented and approved.\n\n\n# PFS-4 (3.13.8, 3.13.10, 3.13.16, 3.8.6): Implement cryptographic controls for data protection including encryption in transit and at rest, with proper key management.\n\n## Control Details:\n\nCryptographic mechanisms protect information during transmission using TLS 1.3 for web traffic, SFTP for file transfers, and other approved encryption protocols. Cryptographic protection is also implemented for sensitive information stored on digital media during transport. Alternative safeguards may be used when cryptographic protection is not feasible.\n\nKey management systems establish and manage cryptographic keys throughout their lifecycle, including generation, distribution, storage, rotation, and destruction. Dedicated key management solutions or cloud-native key management services are used for critical applications.\n\nData at rest encryption uses AES-256 encryption for databases, file systems, and storage volumes containing sensitive information. Encryption keys are managed separately from encrypted data and protected through key management solutions\n\nInfrastructure teams implement cryptographic infrastructure and key management systems, while System Owners coordinate encryption requirements and ensure sensitive data is properly classified and protected according to organizational policies.\n\n# NIS2 Additions\n\n## Cryptography Policy and Procedures (Article 9)\n- **Cryptographic Policy**: Establishment of policies for adequate and effective use of cryptography to protect confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity\n- **Cryptographic Strength**: Determination of cryptographic measures required based on asset classification for data at rest and in transit\n- **Key Management**: Comprehensive approach including key generation, distribution, storage, rotation, recovery, and destruction procedures\n- **Cryptographic Agility**: Following cryptographic agility approaches and state-of-the-art cryptography standards\n\n## Network Security (Article 6.7)\n- **Network Architecture Documentation**: Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation of network architecture\n- **Network Access Controls**: Controls to protect internal network domains from unauthorized access and restrict communications\n- **Remote Access Controls**: Determination and application of controls for remote access to network and information systems\n- **Trusted Communication Channels**: Establishment of trusted channels with assured identification and protection from modification\n\n## Network Segmentation (Article 6.8)\n- **System Segmentation**: Segmenting systems into networks or zones based on risk assessment results\n- **Secured Zones**: Keeping systems critical to operations or safety in secured zones with restricted access\n- **DMZ Implementation**: Deployment of demilitarized zones for secure communication with external networks\n- **Administration Network Separation**: Separation of dedicated administration networks from operational networks\n\n## Asset Management (Article 12)\n- **Asset Classification**: Establishment of classification levels for all assets based on protection requirements\n- **Asset Handling Policy**: Proper handling of assets throughout their lifecycle including acquisition, use, storage, and disposal\n- **Media Protection**: Management of removable storage media with technical prohibitions and security controls","numLines":87,"startLine":1,"totalLines":87}}}
