[Print](javascript:print();)\\n\\nCreated by: Lakshmoji Reddy\\n\\nModified on: Tue, 11 Jul, 2023 at 5:31 AM\\n\\n**Description:**\\n\\nThe process used to identify software programs that are not authorized to execute on systems is commonly referred to as blacklisting. The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute on systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. Whitelisting is the stronger of the two policies for restricting software program execution. In addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of whitelisted software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of whitelisted software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.  \\\\[SP 800-67\\\\] provides guidance on application whitelisting.\\n\\n**Priority**: High\\n\\n**Category**: Baseline Security Configurations\\n\\n**Services Associated with AWS:**\\n\\n- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Security Groups, AWS Systems Manager\\n\\n**Objective Evidence:**\\n\\n- Administrative: documented policies, standards & procedures\\n- Administrative: supporting documentation to demonstrate the \\\"secure practices\\\" used to build technology platform-specific secure baseline configurations\\n- Technical: screenshot of \\\"blacklisting solution\\\" software configuration\\n\\nPossible Technology Considerations :\\n\\n- Blacklisting  Solution\\n- Secure Baseline Configurations (SBC)\\n- Privileged Access Management (PAM)\\n\\n**What needs to be answered :**\\n\\nIs the system configured to only allow authorized software to run and disallow unauthorized software? Is there a defined list of software allowed documented? Is this reviewed at least annually?\\n\\n- Apply Deny-by-Exception Policy for Unauthorized SoftwareDescription: This check ensures that organizations apply a deny-by-exception (blacklisting) policy to prevent the use of unauthorized software within their systems.

The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute on systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. Whitelisting is the stronger of the two policies for restricting software program execution. In addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of whitelisted software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of whitelisted software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.  \\\\[SP 800-67\\\\] provides guidance on application whitelisting.\\n\\n**Priority**: High\\n\\n**Category**: Baseline Security Configurations\\n\\n**Services Associated with AWS:**\\n\\n- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Security Groups, AWS Systems Manager\\n\\n**Objective Evidence:**\\n\\n- Administrative: documented policies, standards & procedures\\n- Administrative: supporting documentation to demonstrate the \\\"secure practices\\\" used to build technology platform-specific secure baseline configurations\\n- Technical: screenshot of \\\"blacklisting solution\\\" software configuration\\n\\nPossible Technology Considerations :\\n\\n- Blacklisting  Solution\\n- Secure Baseline Configurations (SBC)\\n- Privileged Access Management (PAM)\\n\\n**What needs to be answered :**\\n\\nIs the system configured to only allow authorized software to run and disallow unauthorized software?

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171r3 \\n(Revision 3) and SP 800-171Ar3 have been guided and informed by:\\n• The public comments received during the pre-draft call for comments, initial public draft \\ncomment period for SP 800-171r3, the final public draft comment period for SP 800-171r3, and \\nthe initial public draft comment period for SP 800-171Ar3\\n• NIST’s responsibility to meet the requirements of the Federal Information Security \\nModernization Act (FISMA), Executive Order (EO) 13556, CUI federal regulations, and Office of \\nManagement and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130\\nThe following frequently asked questions provide background information and rationale for the changes \\nin SP 800-171r3 and SP 800-171Ar3:\\nWhat is the scope and applicability of SP 800-171r3?\\nThe security requirements in SP 800-171r3 are only applicable to components of nonfederal systems \\nthat process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components.\\nWhat are the significant differences between SP 800-171r2 and SP 800-171r3?\\n• Streamlined introductory information to improve clarity and customer understanding\\n• Eliminated the distinction between basic and derived security requirements\\n• Updated security requirements and families to reflect changes in the SP 800-53r5 control \\ncatalog, SP 800-53B moderate control baseline, and tailoring criteria\\n• Increased the specificity of security requirements to remove ambiguity, improve the \\neffectiveness of implementation, and clarify the scope of assessments\\n• Eliminated the NFO control tailoring category\\n• Introduced a new control tailoring category for controls that are addressed by other related \\ncontrols (ORC)\\n• Introduced organization-defined parameters (ODP) in select security requirements to increase \\nflexibility and to help organizations better manage risk\\n• Clarified the responsibility for assigning ODP values\\n• Removed outdated and redundant security requirements\\n• Combined security requirements (or parts of requirements) with other requirements for \\nconsistency and ease of use\\n• Added security requirements due to control categorization changes\\n• Sequenced the content in the discussion sections to align with the individual parts of the \\nrequirements\\n• Modified the tailoring categories of selected controls and control items (subparts of controls)\\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\\nNIST SP 800-171r3 and NIST SP 800-171Ar3\\nUpdated: May 14, 2024 2\\n• Updated tailoring and mapping tables and developed transition mapping tables that outline \\nchanges between Revision 2 and Revision 3\\n• Added an Appendix to consolidate ODPs in a single location for easy reference\\n• Developed a CUI overlay that is available as a separate document on the NIST publication details \\nwebsite with S\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/fpd\",\n      \"title\": \"NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171 Rev. 3 (Withdrawn), Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations\",\n      \"url\": \"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/fpd\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2023-11-09T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Ron Ross (NIST), Victoria Pillitteri (NIST)\",\n      \"text\": \"**You are viewing this page in an unauthorized frame window.**\\n\\nThis is a potential security issue, you are being redirected to [https://csrc.nist.gov](https://csrc.nist.gov).\\n\\n**Official websites use .gov** A\\n**.gov** website belongs to an official government\\norganization in the United States.\\n\\n**Secure .gov websites use HTTPS** A\\n**lock** (\\nLocked padlock icon) or **https://** means you’ve safely connected to\\nthe .gov website.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a guide to assist businesses with adherence to Defense Federal Acquisition Register Supplement (DFARS) standards. The third family of 14 Families of Requirements for NIST 800-171 compliance is audit and accountability.\\n\\n**What is Audit & Accountability in Terms of NIST 800-171?**\\n\\nAudit and accountability refers to a business maintaining a record of who is performing actions in the environment, when and how, down to the individual user level. NIST 800-171 requires aggregation of 90 days worth of logs, and timely reporting of any incident. A business must maintain system audit records to support the monitoring, analysis, investigation and reporting of unapproved cyber activity, including the ability to generate reports. With appropriate audit trails configured properly a business can detect intrusion attempts or unauthorized access quickly enabling incident response to occur in a timely manner. A SIEM tool enables a business to detect and report an incident. The environment must also be configured to accurately record audit logs. Audit and Accountability consists of 2 Basic and 7 Derived Requirements.\\n\\n**Basic Requirements:**\\n\\n- 3.3.1 Create and retain system audit logs and records to the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or unauthorized system activity.\\n- 3.3.2 Ensure that the actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users, so they can be held accountable for their actions.\\n\\n**Derived Requirements:**\\n\\n- 3.3.3 Review and update logged events\\n- 3.3.4 Alert in the event of an audit logging process failure.\\n- 3.3.5 Correlate audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes for investigation and response to indications of unlawful, unauthorized, suspicious, or unusual activity.\\n- 3.3.6 Provide audit record reduction and report generation to support on-demand analysis and reporting.\\n- 3.3.7 Provide a system capability that compares and synchronizes internal system clocks with an authoritative source to generate time stamps for audit records.\\n- 3.3.8 Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.\\n- 3.3.9 Limit management of audit logging functionality to a subset of privileged users\\n\\nFor information on security log management check out [SP 800-92](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-92.pdf).

Proactive preparation for compliance with these security requirements is crucial in order to avoid potential disruptions to your business operations. This is the third in a series of blogs and is focused on the _Audit and Accountability_ security requirement.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n- Successful cybersecurity practices are based on established controls and system event logging monitoring, auditing, and reporting.\\n- The integration of system capabilities should notify administrators with real-time alerts and reporting along with time stamps for audit records.\\n\\n- The integrity and accuracy of audit logging processes is essential in preventing gaps in security monitoring.\\n- Audit logging and monitoring should be assigned only to identified privileged users.\\n\\n**NIST SP 800-171 – Audit and Accountability Security Requirement Overview**\\n\\nThis blog focuses on the creation and preservation of system audit logs (3.3.1), the unique traceability of system actions (3.3.2), and the importance of reviewing and updating logged events (3.3.3). This NIST SP 800-171 security requirement is crucial in supporting the cybersecurity framework for an organization.\\n\\nAudit and Accountability tools work together to identify, document, and report on auditable system transactions and provide audit records to meet system compliance.\\n\\n- Auditing is the process of systematically examining cybersecurity controls and procedures to assess their effectiveness. This can involve reviewing logs, interviewing personnel, and testing security systems. The goal of an audit is to identify any weaknesses or gaps in the system environment and take corrective action to address them.\\n- Accountability is the process of holding individuals and organizations responsible for their actions. Accountability is achieved through reviewing audit transaction records including the information needed to link audit events to the actions of an individual.\\n\\n**Understanding and Implementing Audit and Accountability**\\n\\n**3.3.1. Creating and retaining system audit logs and records.** The system audit log tracks system activities providing a chronological account for security analysis and compliance. This process involves configuring systems to automatically log key events like user logins, file accesses, and system changes. These logs must be stored securely in a centralized log management system based on the regulatory standards your company is aiming to align to whether it is FISMA, HIPAA, SOX, GLBA, or PCI DSS. Audit logs should be reviewed and backed up on a regular schedule to meet compliance requirements.\\n\\n**3.3.2.

Proactive preparation for compliance with these security requirements is crucial in order to avoid potential disruptions to your business operations. This is the third in a series of blogs and is focused on the _Audit and Accountability_ security requirement.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n- Successful cybersecurity practices are based on established controls and system event logging monitoring, auditing, and reporting.\\n- The integration of system capabilities should notify administrators with real-time alerts and reporting along with time stamps for audit records.\\n\\n- The integrity and accuracy of audit logging processes is essential in preventing gaps in security monitoring.\\n- Audit logging and monitoring should be assigned only to identified privileged users.\\n\\n**NIST SP 800-171 – Audit and Accountability Security Requirement Overview**\\n\\nThis blog focuses on the creation and preservation of system audit logs (3.3.1), the unique traceability of system actions (3.3.2), and the importance of reviewing and updating logged events (3.3.3). This NIST SP 800-171 security requirement is crucial in supporting the cybersecurity framework for an organization.\\n\\nAudit and Accountability tools work together to identify, document, and report on auditable system transactions and provide audit records to meet system compliance.\\n\\n- Auditing is the process of systematically examining cybersecurity controls and procedures to assess their effectiveness. This can involve reviewing logs, interviewing personnel, and testing security systems. The goal of an audit is to identify any weaknesses or gaps in the system environment and take corrective action to address them.\\n- Accountability is the process of holding individuals and organizations responsible for their actions. Accountability is achieved through reviewing audit transaction records including the information needed to link audit events to the actions of an individual.\\n\\n**Understanding and Implementing Audit and Accountability**\\n\\n**3.3.1. Creating and retaining system audit logs and records.** The system audit log tracks system activities providing a chronological account for security analysis and compliance. This process involves configuring systems to automatically log key events like user logins, file accesses, and system changes. These logs must be stored securely in a centralized log management system based on the regulatory standards your company is aiming to align to whether it is FISMA, HIPAA, SOX, GLBA, or PCI DSS. Audit logs should be reviewed and backed up on a regular schedule to meet compliance requirements.\\n\\n**3.3.2. Providing means to link individual system actions to specific users.** Just as every item in a store has a unique barcode to track it, there is a unique identifier for every user action that takes place within an organization’s\",\n      \"image\": \"https://ibsscorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/shutterstock_1421446100_cyberBackground.jpg\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"searchTime\": 5228.9,\n  \"costDollars\": {\n    \"total\": 0.008,\n    \"search\": {\n      \"neural\": 0.005\n    },\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"text\": 0.003\n    }\n  }\n}"}]}

This publication provides\\nfederal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the confidentiality\\nof CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations. The\\nrequirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit\\nCUI _or_ that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are intended\\nfor use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established\\nbetween those agencies and nonfederal organizations. This publication can be used\\nin conjunction with its companion publication, NIST Special Publication 800-171A,\\nwhich provides a comprehensive set of procedures to assess the security requirements.\\n\\n## Keywords\\n\\nControlled Unclassified Information, Executive Order 13556, FIPS Publication 199,\\nFIPS Publication 200, FISMA, NIST Special Publication 800-53, nonfederal organizations,\\nnonfederal systems, organization-defined parameter, security assessment, security\\ncontrol, security requirement.\\n\\n## Disclaimer\\n\\nCertain equipment, instruments, software, or materials, commercial or non-commercial,\\nare identified in this paper in order to specify the experimental procedure adequately.\\nSuch identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement of any product or\\nservice by NIST, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are\\nnecessarily the best available for the purpose.\\n\\nThere may be references in this publication to other publications currently under\\ndevelopment by NIST in accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities.

This publication provides\\nfederal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the confidentiality\\nof CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations. The\\nrequirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit\\nCUI _or_ that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are intended\\nfor use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established\\nbetween those agencies and nonfederal organizations. This publication can be used\\nin conjunction with its companion publication, NIST Special Publication 800-171A,\\nwhich provides a comprehensive set of procedures to assess the security requirements.\\n\\n## Keywords\\n\\nControlled Unclassified Information, Executive Order 13556, FIPS Publication 199,\\nFIPS Publication 200, FISMA, NIST Special Publication 800-53, nonfederal organizations,\\nnonfederal systems, organization-defined parameter, security assessment, security\\ncontrol, security requirement.\\n\\n## Disclaimer\\n\\nCertain equipment, instruments, software, or materials, commercial or non-commercial,\\nare identified in this paper in order to specify the experimental procedure adequately.\\nSuch identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement of any product or\\nservice by NIST, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are\\nnecessarily the best available for the purpose.\\n\\nThere may be references in this publication to other publications currently under\\ndevelopment by NIST in accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities.

Always reference the current revision\n\n### Stakeholder Roles\n\n#### IT System Owner (`*-so.md`)\n- **Technical infrastructure responsibility**: Person maintaining servers, databases, networks, cloud resources\n- **Implementation focus**: How technical controls are configured and maintained\n- **Evidence they provide**: Technical configurations, system logs, infrastructure documentation\n\n#### Business Owner (`*-bo.md`) \n- **Application functionality responsibility**: Person understanding what employees do with the application\n- **Business context focus**: User roles, business processes, functional requirements\n- **Evidence they provide**: Business justifications, user role definitions, process documentation\n\n#### IT Security (`*-itsec.md`)\n- **Compliance verification responsibility**: Person checking that controls are properly implemented\n- **Validation focus**: Verification dates, compliance status, assessment results\n- **Evidence they provide**: Assessment reports, verification dates, compliance status\n\n### Question Structure Template\n\nEach question must follow this exact structure:\n\n```markdown\n# Question [N]: [Control Name] ([Control Number])\n\n[Brief description of what needs to be provided]\n\nControl covered: [Control Number] - [Control description]\nControls related: [Any cross-references to other controls for evidence]\n\n## What to submit\n\n[Specific instructions on what data/date to provide, following config-mgmt examples]\n- Use format: \"The date (MM/DD/YYYY) when...\"\n- Include future date guidance: \"If this is planned, please mention the future date\"\n- Include N/A handling: \"If you consider this control is not applicable, please input 02/02/2000\"\n\n## What good evidence looks like\n\n[Concrete examples of what constitutes proper evidence for this control]\n- Specific documentation types\n- Technical configurations\n- Process descriptions\n- Tool outputs or reports\n```\n\n## Content Standards\n\n### Date Collection Format\n- Always request dates in MM/DD/YYYY format\n- Always provide guidance for planned implementations\n- Always provide standard N/A date (02/02/2000) for non-applicable controls\n\n### Evidence Examples\n- Provide specific, actionable examples\n- Reference real tools and technologies (Azure, OCI, Oracle DB, etc.)\n- Include concrete deliverables (logs, reports, configurations)\n- Cross-reference related controls where evidence overlaps\n\n### Language Guidelines\n- Use clear, role-appropriate language for each stakeholder\n- Technical detail for System Owners\n- Business context for Business Owners  \n- Compliance verification for IT Security\n- Avoid jargon that doesn't match the stakeholder's expertise\n\n## Quality Checklist\nBefore finalizing any survey:\n\n- [ ] One question per NIST 800-171 Rev 3 control\n- [ ] Control number clearly identified in each question\n- [ ] Appropriate stakeholder role assignment\n- [ ] Standard question structure followed\n- [ ] Date format and N/A guidance included\n- [ ] Concrete evidence examples provided\n- [ ] Cross-references to related controls included\n- [ ] Language appropriate for target stakeholder\n\n## Example Reference\nSee `/surveys/config-mgmt (03.04)/` folder for examples of properly structured questions following these guidelines.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":28,"oldLines":10,"newStart":28,"newLines":12,"lines":[" -

Application Rationalization can be a one off initiative but, is often part of a continuous process to ensure that applications are best aligned to enable business capabilities. Read this article to learn about the scope of Application Rationalization, the choices we’ve made regarding implementation, and how to implement it in practice.\\n\\n# Purpose, Scope, and Rationale\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nApplication Rationalization illustrates how organizations can leverage the relationship between applications and business capabilities to drive decision making around an application’s overall business and technical fit. The process highlights candidates for rationalization in order to facilitate further business case and impact analysis processes.\\n\\nAR assists organizations in answering the following questions:\\n\\n1. How do we identify low-hanging fruits that will reduce cost and give us more agility to act faster?\\n\\n2. Where can we identify cost savings by eliminating duplication?\\n\\n3. Where can we realize potential cost cuts?\\n\\n4. How can we reduce the overall IT Risk Surface as it relates to a 'Long Tail' or 'history of ungoverned' organic IT acquisition?\\n\\n5. How do I manage the impact, risk, and stakeholders of doing application rationalization?\\n\\n6. In what applications should I increase the level of investment and what applications should I try to phase out?\\n\\n\\n## Scope\\n\\nThere are many different strategic justifications for an organization to conduct a rationalization initiative including elimination/consolidation, economizing, modernization, retiring aging applications, a bloated IT portfolio, etc.\\n\\nThis version of the Application Rationalization Use Case Guide sets the scope for application consolidation and elimination. Consolidation is where multiple applications realize the same capability, creating functional overlaps. Through consolidation, we look to remove these redundancies to drive efficiency and reduce IT spending. This will act as a catalyst for several other types of elimination based application rationalization efforts, like Mergers & Acquisitions, and Modernization, as it is foun\",\n      \"image\": \"https://downloads.intercomcdn.eu/i/o/1981/308ddbec36d9a4cd1dba1694/9aa3a9e0fca52850613d26338a05ebd3.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://intercom-help.eu/ardoq-eu-2/assets/favicon\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.archipeg.com/learn/togaf-9p2-content-v1-metamodel\",\n      \"title\": \"TOGAF 9.2 Content v1.0 Metamodel -

The metamodel allows Ardoq to automatically create visualizations, as well as validate input.\\n\\nIf you use the “Business Process” metamodel it looks like this:\\n\\nThis is a basic hierarchy showing how Business Processes are the top-level “parent” and different types of steps are children of a Business Process.\\n\\nSee the [Metamodel Editor](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44143-how-to-edit-a-metamodel) for more information on how you can edit metamodels.\\n\\n## Available metamodels\\n\\nThe following models are available out-of-the-box:\\n\\n- Application Service\\n\\n- ArchiMate Application Layer\\n\\n- ArchiMate Business Layer\\n\\n- ArchiMate Implementation & Migration Layer\\n\\n- ArchiMate Motivation Layer\\n\\n- ArchiMate Physical Layer\\n\\n- ArchiMate Strategy Layer\\n\\n- ArchiMate Technology Layer\\n\\n- Blank Workspace\\n\\n- Business Process\\n\\n- Chapter Model\\n\\n- Role-Based Process\\n\\n- Data Flow\\n\\n- Enterprise Integration Model\\n\\n- Infrastructure\\n\\n- Requirements\\n\\n- Master Data\\n\\n- Microservice\\n\\n- Process Flow\\n\\n\\n# Further Reading\\n\\n[On the Metamodel Editor](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44143-how-to-edit-a-metamodel)\\n\\n[Scenario Metamodel Merge](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44029-how-to-update-your-scenarios-metamodel-with-your-mainline-metamodel)\\n\\n[Autogenerated Metamodel](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44060-autogenerated-metamodel) ​ [Manage Component Types and Metamodel](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44068-manage-component-types-and-metamodel) ​ [Scenario Metamodel Merge](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44029-how-to-update-your-scenarios-metamodel-with-your-\",\n      \"image\": \"https://downloads.intercomcdn.eu/i/o/1981/308ddbec36d9a4cd1dba1694/9aa3a9e0fca52850613d26338a05ebd3.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://intercom-help.eu/ardoq-eu-2/assets/favicon\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/43925-application-rationalization-metamodel\",\n      \"title\": \"Application Rationalization Metamodel | Ardoq Help\",\n      \"url\": \"https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/43925-application-rationalization-metamodel\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-04-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"[Skip to main content](https://help.ardoq.com/help.ardoq.com#main-content)\\n\\nTable of contents\\n\\n[All Collections](https://help.ardoq.com/en/) [Ardoq Use Case Solutions](https://help.ardoq.com/en/collections/6889-ardoq-use-case-solutions) [IT Optimization Series (Rationalization, Cloud Migration, and Modernization)](https://help.ardoq.com/en/collections/10373-it-optimization-series-rationalization-cloud-migration-and-modernization)\\n\\nApplication Rationalization Metamodel\\n\\n# Application Rationalization Metamodel\\n\\nApplication Rationalization enables organizations to optimize their application portfolio and IT spend.\\n\\nWritten by Kristine Marhilevica\\nUpdated over 4 months ago\\n\\nTable of contents\\n\\nApplication Rationalization (AR) is the effort to strategically identify business applications across an organization to determine which should be tolerated, migrated, invested in, or eliminated. Application Rationalization can be a one off initiative but, is often part of a continuous process to ensure that applications are best aligned to enable business capabilities. Read this article to learn about the scope of Application Rationalization, the choices we’ve made regarding implementation, and how to implement it in practice.\\n\\n# Purpose, Scope, and Rationale\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nApplication Rationalization illustrates how organizations can leverage the relationship between applications and business capabilities to drive decision making around an application’s overall business and technical fit. The process highlights candidates for rationalization in order to facilitate further business case and impact analysis processes.\\n\\nAR assists organizations in answering the following questions:\\n\\n1. How do we identify low-hanging fruits that will reduce cost and give us more agility to act faster?\\n\\n2. Where can we identify cost savings by eliminating duplication?\\n\\n3. Where can we realize potential cost cuts?\\n\\n4. How can we reduce the overall IT Risk Surface as it relates to a 'Long Tail' or 'history of ungoverned' organic IT acquisition?\\n\\n5. How do I manage the impact, risk, and stakeholders of doing application rationalization?\\n\\n6. In what applications should I increase the level of investment and what applications should I try to phase out?\\n\\n\\n## Scope\\n\\nThere are many different strategic justifications for an organization to conduct a rationalization initiative including elimination/consolidation, economizing, modernization, retiring aging applications, a bloated IT portfolio, etc.\\n\\nThis version of the Application Rationalization Use Case Guide sets the scope for application consolidation and elimination. Consolidation is where multiple applications realize the same capability, creating functional overlaps. Through consolidation, we look to remove these redundancies to drive efficiency and reduce IT spending. This will act as a catalyst for several other types of elimination based application rationalization efforts, like Mergers & Acquisitions, and Modernization, as it is foun\",\n      \"image\": \"https://downloads.intercomcdn.eu/i/o/1981/308ddbec36d9a4cd1dba1694/9aa3a9e0fca52850613d26338a05ebd3.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://intercom-help.eu/ardoq-eu-2/assets/favicon\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.archipeg.com/learn/togaf-9p2-content-v1-metamodel\",\n      \"title\": \"TOGAF 9.2 Content v1.0 Metamodel -

However, in trying to collect as much information as possible, surveys can sometimes become too lengthy and tedious for stakeholders to complete. Respondents might have to go through a lot of questions that are not always relevant to them.\\n\\nUsing conditional questions in Surveys, information capture can be more focused, only presenting follow-up questions relevant to the respondent based on their previous answers.\\n\\n## **What’s a Conditional Question?**\\n\\nA conditional question cannot exist independently, it is always connected to another question. Before defining what a conditional question is, let's define **the main question**.\\n\\n**Main (parent) question** \\\\- The question in the survey with the highest hierarchy level. It can have conditional questions and can only be a field question. Example: _Does this application process PII? (YES/NO)._\\n\\n**Conditional (child) question** \\\\- A question that will appear only if a user gives a specific answer to the parent question. These questions can only be a reference or field questions. Following from the previous example, if the respondent selects “YES”, the following conditional question can then be shown to them: _Which processing activities are performed? What PII is being processed?_\\n\\n**Difference Between Question Flow for Surveys Without and With Conditional Questions:**\\n\\nA few things to keep in mind before you get started:\\n\\nYou can only add conditional questions to **field type questions.**\\n\\nThe field question type must be either **a checkbox or a list.**\\n\\nConditional questions can either be **reference or field questions**.\\n\\n## **How to Add a Conditional Question to Your Survey in a Few Simple Steps**\\n\\nWith the definition and restrictions of conditional questions covered, we can now get to how to start using them in your surveys using an example survey from Ardoq's [Application Lifecycle Management](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44013-getting-started-with-application-lifecycle-management) (ALM) use case bundle.\\n\\nStep 1. Navigate to Survey Builder > Survey Sections and find the **field question** you'd like to add a conditional question to.\\n\\nStep 2. Let's say you want to branch the **Application Hosting Type** question based on\\n\\nthe hosting provider type a respondent selects.\\n\\nStep 3. Scroll down to the bottom of this question and select \\\"Conditional field question\\\"\\n\\nStep 4.

However, in trying to collect as much information as possible, surveys can sometimes become too lengthy and tedious for stakeholders to complete. Respondents might have to go through a lot of questions that are not always relevant to them.\\n\\nUsing conditional questions in Surveys, information capture can be more focused, only presenting follow-up questions relevant to the respondent based on their previous answers.\\n\\n## **What’s a Conditional Question?**\\n\\nA conditional question cannot exist independently, it is always connected to another question. Before defining what a conditional question is, let's define **the main question**.\\n\\n**Main (parent) question** \\\\- The question in the survey with the highest hierarchy level. It can have conditional questions and can only be a field question. Example: _Does this application process PII? (YES/NO)._\\n\\n**Conditional (child) question** \\\\- A question that will appear only if a user gives a specific answer to the parent question. These questions can only be a reference or field questions. Following from the previous example, if the respondent selects “YES”, the following conditional question can then be shown to them: _Which processing activities are performed? What PII is being processed?_\\n\\n**Difference Between Question Flow for Surveys Without and With Conditional Questions:**\\n\\nA few things to keep in mind before you get started:\\n\\nYou can only add conditional questions to **field type questions.**\\n\\nThe field question type must be either **a checkbox or a list.**\\n\\nConditional questions can either be **reference or field questions**.\\n\\n## **How to Add a Conditional Question to Your Survey in a Few Simple Steps**\\n\\nWith the definition and restrictions of conditional questions covered, we can now get to how to start using them in your surveys using an example survey from Ardoq's [Application Lifecycle Management](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44013-getting-started-with-application-lifecycle-management) (ALM) use case bundle.\\n\\nStep 1. Navigate to Survey Builder > Survey Sections and find the **field question** you'd like to add a conditional question to.\\n\\nStep 2. Let's say you want to branch the **Application Hosting Type** question based on\\n\\nthe hosting provider type a respondent selects.\\n\\nStep 3. Scroll down to the bottom of this question and select \\\"Conditional field question\\\"\\n\\nStep 4.

Conditional Survey Logic** (Hybrid Approach)\n- **Purpose**: Smart surveys that adapt based on existing data\n- **How it works**: Survey questions only appear if certain fields are empty\n- **Implementation**: Pre-populate dates if Risk Plan/Treatment fields exist, only ask for dates if fields are missing\n\n## **Recommended Implementation:**\n\n```\nFor 3.11.1 Risk Assessment:\n- IF \"Risk Plan\" field contains data → \"Deployment Date (3.11.1)\" = TODAY()\n\nFor 3.11.2 Risk Response:  \n- IF \"Risk Treatment\" field contains data → \"Deployment Date (3.11.2)\" = TODAY()\n```\n\n**Advantages:**\n- ✅ No questionnaires needed\n- ✅ Automatic compliance date assignment\n- ✅ Real-time updates when risk documentation is added\n- ✅ Uses native Ardoq ARM metamodel functionality\n\nThis approach eliminates the need for the risk management surveys entirely - the system automatically detects when risk documentation exists and assigns compliance dates accordingly."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3513,"cache_read_input_tokens":79905,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3513,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":502,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSY8zqPMtS1Z2ZcgCxE8r","type":"assistant","uuid":"d6b63e72-9ccb-4fa3-b027-aad672880e89","timestamp":"2025-08-27T11:30:58.404Z"}

(Just in time for the [NIST SP 800-171 Rev.3](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/ipd)!)\\n\\n#### 3.14 System and Information Integrity\\n\\nThis security control is included to do exactly what it sounds like, ensure the integrity of systems and any information that is processed, stored, or transmitted by your organization.  It focuses on preventing unauthorized access and unauthorized changes by identifying and responding to detected security threats.\\n\\nCompliance with Requirement 3.14 involves implementing specific security controls based on your organization’s risk assessments and regularly updating your processes as new threats and vulnerabilities evolve.  Your organization should have a formal, documented program in place to ensure regular and timely maintenance of all critical information systems, through ongoing monitoring, implementing applicable patches, scanning for malicious code, and identifying unauthorized access.\\n\\nIt is also important to conduct periodic assessments or audits to ensure all organizational departments are following your documented processes and have implemented the recommended controls.\\n\\n#### The Basic Security Requirements from 3.14 include:\\n\\n- **14.1 Identify, report, and correct system flaws in a timely manner.**\\n\\nManaging the process of deploying security updates is just one component of your organization’s vulnerability management program, often referred to as patch management.

Patches are pieces of software code that are installed to improve or fix an application, and once installed will reduce your organization’s attack service and risk for exposure.\\n\\nCybercriminals continue to compromise organizational systems through unpatched software.

They're considering two approaches:\n\n1. Ask system owners to respond with their vulnerability mitigation strategies\n2. Just reference Tenable (vulnerability scanner) and manually update fields as needed\n\nThey've identified some key challenges:\n- Without a system inventory, they're not sure if all assets are being monitored\n- SaaS applications are outside their direct control but they can ask for third-party assurance like vendor audit reports\n\nThis is a practical question about implementation strategy. Let me think through this:\n\n**System Owner Survey Approach:**\n- Pros: Gets stakeholder involvement, captures what they know about their systems\n- Cons: May not have complete visibility, might get inconsistent responses\n\n**Tenable + Manual Approach:**\n- Pros: More centralized, consistent technical approach\n- Cons: Might miss assets not in Tenable, requires manual maintenance\n\n**Key Issues:**\n1. Asset inventory completeness - this is fundamental to vulnerability management\n2. SaaS applications - different risk model, relies on vendor security\n3. Coverage gaps - how to ensure nothing falls through the cracks\n\nI think the best approach would be a hybrid that addresses the asset inventory issue first, then builds on that for vulnerability management.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":94924,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":94924,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSYE2wqwPQt9VNcPg8EFw","type":"assistant","uuid":"84f363f3-f0a2-433b-8143-439e089b7d33","timestamp":"2025-08-27T12:36:57.687Z"}
