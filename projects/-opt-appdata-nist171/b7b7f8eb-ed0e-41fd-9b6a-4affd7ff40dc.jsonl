This publication provides\\nfederal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the confidentiality\\nof CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations. The\\nrequirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit\\nCUI _or_ that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are intended\\nfor use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established\\nbetween those agencies and nonfederal organizations.

This publication provides\\nfederal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the confidentiality\\nof CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations. The\\nrequirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit\\nCUI _or_ that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are intended\\nfor use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established\\nbetween those agencies and nonfederal organizations. This publication can be used\\nin conjunction with its companion publication, NIST Special Publication 800-171A,\\nwhich provides a comprehensive set of procedures to assess the security requirements.\\n\\n## Keywords\\n\\nControlled Unclassified Information, Executive Order 13556, FIPS Publication 199,\\nFIPS Publication 200, FISMA, NIST Special Publication 800-53, nonfederal organizations,\\nnonfederal systems, organization-defined parameter, security assessment, security\\ncontrol, security requirement.\\n\\n## Disclaimer\\n\\nCertain equipment, instruments, software, or materials, commercial or non-commercial,\\nare identified in this paper in order to specify the experimental procedure adequately.\\nSuch identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement of any product or\\nservice by NIST, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are\\nnecessarily the best available for the purpose.\\n\\nThere may be references in this publication to other publications currently under\\ndevelopment by NIST in accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities.
